# Gradient-Descent---Boston-Dataset
Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn. You are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. As studied in lecture, your task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.


1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.
2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results.
